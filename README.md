# SportsKart
This is my first Advanced Java project. I have used the concepts of JSPs and Web Designing for the front end and JDBC for the backend. The idea was to build a shopping site where anyone can buy any sports item, one is seeking for.

This project is made on JSPs(i.e Java Server Pages), so client will need to run it on any server like ApacheTomCat 9.0.

To run this project, client will need to copy and paste all jsp files, that i have provided in folder named "source files", inside the Web Content directory of your web project. Also the images folder must be copied inside the Web Content folder along with those jsp files.

I have uploaded the source files and images but no database file because, my aim was to help other users with their projects instead of giving them one. So users need to create their own database and link it with the source codes.

Demo SceenShots are provided in "Screenshots" folder.
